# BeneDict
A code generating wizard that works on  Fredrik Ludvigsen's SerializableDictionary on wiki.unity3d.com

# Purpose
[SerializableDictionary on wiki.unity3d.com](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/SerializableDictionary) requires Dictinary types to be declared as Unity doesn't parse generics. The process is prone to error and is time consuming. BeneDict is a simple code generating wizard that does that for you with just 3 text fields. After that just use the generated code as usual.

# Guide
- Enter the Dictionary Key and Value types. These are case sensitive. The wizard does not check if the types are actually available

- One button at a time, the code is copied to your clipboard.

- Paste the generated code in the implementations files and access your *baseName*Dictionary class.
